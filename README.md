<h1> This is the simple open channel 2D simulation</h1>
<h2> Change log</h2>
<p> The code is not complete there are some bug will solve.</p>
<p> The source is include ballast, track, and rail.</p>
<p> Simulation is on side view and it will automatic Q in and out with flow tracking.</p>
<p> This project aim to case study in the track railway to with automatic flow rate incresing.</p>
<h2>To run the source code</h2>
<h3>Please install the openflow first (recommend to install and run it in linux for the easiest way to use it).</h3>
<p>Run the environment first.</p>
<p>Mesh of ballast will use hexagon first you can adjest in system directory.</p>
